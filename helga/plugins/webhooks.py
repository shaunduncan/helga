"""
Webhook HTTP server plugin and core webhook API

Webhooks provide a way to expose HTTP endpoints that can interact with helga. A command
plugin manages an HTTP server that is run on a port specified by setting
:data:`helga.settings.WEBHOOKS_PORT` (default 8080). An additional, optional setting that can be
used for routes requiring HTTP basic auth is :data:`helga.settings.WEBHOOKS_CREDENTIALS`,
which should be a list of tuples, where each tuple is a pair of (username, password).

Routes are URL path endpoints. On the surface they are just python callables decorated using
:func:`@route <route>`. The route decorated must be given a path regex, and optional list of
HTTP methods to accept. Webhook plugins must be registered in the same way normal plugins are
registered, using setuptools entry_points. However, they must belong to the entry_point group
``helga_webhooks``. For example::

    setup(entry_points={
        'helga_webhooks': [
            'api = myapi.decorated_route'
        ]
    })
