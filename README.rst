About
-----
Helga is a full-featured chat bot for Python 3 using `Twisted`_. Helga originally started
as a python fork of a perl-based IRC bot `olga`_, but has grown considerably since then. Early
versions limited to support to IRC, but now include other services like XMPP and HipChat.
Full documentation can be found at http://helga.readthedocs.org.


Supported Backends
------------------

As of version 1.7.0, helga supports IRC, XMPP, and HipChat out of the box. Note, however, that
helga originally started as an IRC bot, so much of the terminology will reflect that. The current
status of XMPP and HipChat support is very limited and somewhat beta. In the future, helga may
have a much more robust and pluggable backend system to allow connections to any number of chat
services.


Contributing
------------
Contributions are **always** welcomed, whether they be in the form of bug fixes, enhancements,
or just bug reports. To report any issues, please create a ticket on `github`_. For code
changes, please note that any pull request will be denied a merge if the test suite fails.

Docker
------

A docker compose file is included, which has a irc server and mongodb instance. Once you bring
the cluster using `docker-compose up`, you can connect to the irc on localhost port 6667, and
join the #test channel.
