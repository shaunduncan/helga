.. _about:

About
-----
Helga is a full-featured chat bot for Python 3 using `Twisted`_. Helga originally started
as a python fork of a perl-based IRC bot `olga`_, but has grown considerably since then. Early
versions limited to support to IRC, but now include other services like XMPP and HipChat.


.. _supported_backends:

Supported Backends
------------------

As of version 1.7.0, helga supports IRC, XMPP, and HipChat out of the box. Note, however, that
helga originally started as an IRC bot, so much of the terminology will reflect that. The current
status of XMPP and HipChat support is very limited and somewhat beta. In the future, helga may
have a much more robust and pluggable backend system to allow connections to any number of chat
services.
